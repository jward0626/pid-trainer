# PID Trainer
**By Jacky Li from HKUST**

An interactive simulator for learning **PID control** by tuning a differential-drive “robot” to track a moving centerline.  
Includes realistic imperfections (sensor noise, actuator lag, steering bias), real-time plots, and an automatic tuning method: **Shadow Simulation Search**.

# PID Trainer

**PID Trainer** is a research-oriented, interactive sandbox for learning **PID control** and experimenting with **automatic gain search** in a noisy, biased, closed-loop simulation.

It simulates a differential-drive robot tracking a scrolling sinusoidal track under **sensor noise**, **actuator lag**, and **systematic steering bias**. You can tune gains manually and see real-time error plots. It also includes an initial AUTO mode powered by **Shadow Simulation Search** (short-horizon screening + full-cycle validation). More auto PID methods will be added in future updates.

> **Goal:** Education + experimentation — build intuition for PID tuning and prototype/compare auto-tuning algorithms.

## Features

### Manual tuning (interactive)
- Live adjustment of **Kp / Ki / Kd** and **Trim**
- Immediate feedback on:
  - tracking error (body + lookahead)
  - oscillation / overshoot
  - control effort and smoothness

### AUTO mode (v1): Shadow Simulation Search
- Maintains a **Champion** (best-known gains) and proposes **Challengers**
- Candidate evaluation pipeline:
  - **Quick horizon cost** (fast screening)
  - **Full-cycle cost** (validation across one track wavelength)
- Swaps only if the challenger is meaningfully better (configurable margin)

### Visualization / instrumentation
- **Error chart:** true body error + noisy measured lookahead error
- **Improvement chart:** cycle-average error vs best-so-far + swap markers
- Smooth HUD readouts + cycle progress in AUTO

## Requirements
- Python **3.9+** (recommended)
- `pygame`

---

## Installation

    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
    # .venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
    pip install pygame

Optional `requirements.txt`:
    pygame>=2.0

---

## Run

    python pid_trainer.py

(Replace `pid_trainer.py` with your actual filename if different.)

---

## Controls

### Global
- `ESC` — quit
- `SPACE` — pause / resume
- `R` — reset simulation
- `A` — toggle AUTO (`OFF` ↔ `LEARN`)

### Manual mode (AUTO = OFF)
- `UP / DOWN` — select parameter **B / P / I / D / T**
- `LEFT / RIGHT` — adjust selected parameter

**Parameter mapping**
- `B` = Base PWM (speed baseline)
- `P` = Kp
- `I` = Ki
- `D` = Kd
- `T` = Trim (left/right bias compensation)

## How AUTO Works (Shadow Simulation Search)

AUTO is intentionally designed to be simple and transparent so learners can read and modify the method.

At the end of each “cycle” (≈ one track wavelength), the algorithm:
1. Samples candidate gain sets around the current best **Champion** (and current gains)
2. Uses a **short-horizon shadow simulation** to quickly choose a promising **Challenger**
3. Runs a **full-cycle shadow validation** for both champion and challenger
4. Swaps only if the challenger is better by a margin:

    pred_chall < pred_champ * SWAP_MARGIN

### Cost function (high level)
The shadow simulator accumulates weighted penalties for:
- tracking error (squared)
- excessive spin (`omega^2`)
- spin rate normalized by speed
- control magnitude (`u^2`)
- control change (`(Δu)^2`)

Weights you can tune in the code:
- `W_E2, W_SPIN2, W_SPINR2, W_U2, W_DU2`

## Roadmap
Planned additions (future updates):
- Additional **auto PID search/tuning methods**, such as:
  - random search baselines (for comparison)
  - grid / Bayesian-style search
  - gradient-free optimizers (CMA-ES / NES-style)
  - classical heuristics (e.g., Ziegler–Nichols variants) adapted to this simulation
- More environments / tracks:
  - step disturbances, sharper turns, different track shapes
  - speed schedules and constraints
- Better reproducibility & logging:
  - deterministic seeds
  - export gain history + metrics

---

## Educational Notes
PID Trainer highlights common real-world issues that affect tuning:
- noisy measurements (`SENSOR_NOISE_STD`)
- actuator dynamics (`ACTUATOR_LAG_TAU`)
- small systematic biases (`STEERING_BIAS`)
- trade-offs between aggressiveness and smoothness

This project is **not** intended as a physically exact model of a specific robot platform. It is a controllable sandbox that behaves “realistically enough” for learning and algorithm comparisons.
